***********************************
        OPERATION QUEUE
***********************************
  
An operation queue invokes its queued Operation objects based on their priority and readiness. After you add an operation to a queue,
it remains in the queue until the operation finishes its task. You can’t directly remove an operation from a queue after you add it.


Important Note
Operation queues retain operations until the operations finish, and queues themselves are retained until all operations are finished.
Suspending an operation queue with operations that aren’t finished can result in a memory leak.
